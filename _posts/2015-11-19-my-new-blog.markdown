Welcome to my first post!

I've made a decision to rework my personal website into a blog format, moving away from the old bullet-pointed-list-in-a-bootstrap-template style into a much more palatable experience for all.

I intend to use this space to showcase and write up on hobby projects I embark on. Some of them will involve coding and some of them will involve knitting. The best ones might even touch on both.

Cheers!
Laurie
