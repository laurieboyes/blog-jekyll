**_Tl;dr_** _I made a little service to create a supermarket-aisle-sorted, quantity-merged shopping list for my spreadsheet of recipes (and you can use it too!)_

### The pitch

Thereâ€™s no side project more satisfying than one that optimises my day-to-day life in some even very small way.

It doesnâ€™t matter to me if hundreds of similar solutions already exist and many are well designed and available for free. None of them will ever work in _exactly the way I want them to_ and integrate seamlessly with my current habits.\*

\*_Iâ€™d like to make it clear to any potential employers that this is a philosophy I apply to side projects but not in my professional work where I aim to be unflinchingly pragmatic._

### I <3 spreadsheets

As anyone whoâ€™s ever shared a residence with me will tell you, I love a good spreadsheet. Arguably Iâ€™ve made spreadsheets to solve problems I donâ€™t really have, but I take a lot of joy in them all the same.

![my adventure time watch record spreadsheet](/assets/img/yummy-spreadsheets/adventure-time-spreadsheet.png){: class="edgeless-image"}
(case in point: my adventure time watch record spreadsheet)

Perhaps my favourite is my _recipe spreadsheet_, which has matured over the past few years, and is a nice way for me to record all the dinners Iâ€™ve made that I want to remember for another time (and those I should remember to avoid).

### Inconvenience food

However, every time I want to plan a week of meals I have to do the following:

- Click through to each of my chosen recipes and for each one close on average maybe 4 obstructive adverts and/or privacy policy banners
- Find the list of ingredients on each page (not always as easy as you might imagine)
- Manually merge ingredient quantities, e.g. 2 onions for 1 meal + 1 onion for another = 3 onions
- Manually group the items roughly by location so Iâ€™m not zigzagging around the crowded supermarket in red-faced frustration.

### Automate the boring stuff

_So_ I made a thing which will do the tedious work for me ðŸŽ‰ Thereâ€™s a bit of upfront tedium in getting all the ingredients for each meal in a neat format but itâ€™s only once per meal and when itâ€™s in the spirit of saving time in the future, it can even be fun (uh, in my opinion).

This side project used the following tech:

- NodeJS (what else?)
- TypeScript (Ooh, type-safety, how novel)
- Serverless/AWS Lambda (Itâ€™s the future)
- The Google sheets API
- Some _sick_ google sheets formulas that I was very pleased with

Iâ€™ll go into more detail on how this went later on.

Mate, you can use this too! If you want.

Hereâ€™s a generic meal spreadsheet I adapted from the one Iâ€™ve honed over a period of extended and regular use and have poured lots of love into. You can copy it and make your own:

And hereâ€™s the codez, which you can deploy to your own Amazon Web Services account, if youâ€™re so inclined:

### How does it work though?

So I have my meals spreadsheet. Every time I try out a new recipe, I add it to the list, along with a load of extra data.\*

\*_Juuust in case youâ€™re interested, my extra data includes:_

- _Comments, such as â€˜Nice but go easier on the szechuan pepper next time because Soph thought she was having a strokeâ€™_
- _When we last had it (being able to sort by recency is good because it makes it easier to find things we've not had in a while)_
- _Whether we typically get any leftovers out of it_
- _Whether it's sufficiently low-effort to make on a weeknight_
- _Whether I can get all the ingredients from the Tesco Express nearby_
- _Whether itâ€™s vegetarian (Iâ€™m not currently a vegetarian but itâ€™s good to when Iâ€™m considering entertaining)_
- _Total time taken (for the rare occasion on which I remember to record it)_

Iâ€™ve added a new checkbox field to the spreadsheet so I can select which ones I want included in my shopping list:

![checkbox](/assets/img/yummy-spreadsheets/checkbox.png){: class="edgeless-image"}
How neat is that

On another sheet, Iâ€™ve entered my list of ingredients for each of my meals:

![ingredients](/assets/img/yummy-spreadsheets/ingredients.png){: class="edgeless-image"}

Cool.

And on yet another sheet (I did warn you about the upfront labour), I have a list of ingredients and their types:

![ingredient-types](/assets/img/yummy-spreadsheets/ingredient-types.png){: class="edgeless-image"}

Cool cool cool, ready to go.

When Iâ€™m getting ready to head out to the shops, I tick the checkboxes against each of my desired meals, and click the link to the API Gateway thatâ€™s in front of my shopping list generator lambda function.

The lambda function uses the Google Sheets API to ask my spreadsheet what up and what the ingredients are for the meals I want.

It then munges together all the ingredient quantities, with some degree of tolerance for different units (e.g. itâ€™ll happily merge grams and kilograms), sorts them by their â€˜typesâ€™ I also defined on the spreadsheet, and returns me a nice convenient list:

![finished-list](/assets/img/yummy-spreadsheets/finished-list.png){: class="edgeless-image"}

It may not be pretty visually, but a low-stress supermarket experience is a beautiful thing.

### Bits that were interesting (relatively)

Iâ€™ll spare you _all_ of the details, but certain parts of this side project were particularly fun to do.

#### Parsing the ingredients

I needed a way of entering ingredients that found a compromise between making them easy to add and making it easy for my list generator to understand them with its hyper-literal robot mind.

After a small amount of deliberation I settled on a system where the first token (by which I mean all of the characters before the first space) always defines the quantity:

<span class='highlight'>3cloves</span> garlic<br/>
<span class='highlight'>some</span> fresh ginger<br/>
<span class='highlight'>4</span> spring onions<br/>
<span class='highlight'>1tsp</span> szechuan peppercorns<br/>

This system gives the my code a leg up in understanding whatâ€™s going on, as it can easily pick out the text before the first space. Itâ€™s then a case of using regular expressions to pick out the number and, if there is one, the unit.

![ingredients-regex](/assets/img/yummy-spreadsheets/ingredients-regex.gif){: class="edgeless-image"}
I _love_ it when I find a good reason to use regular expressions (thanks [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/))

Itâ€™s also pretty easy to enter them with my human typing fingers, so itâ€™s a win-win

#### Some _sick_ google sheets formulas (formulae?)

This project definitely stretched my spreadsheet formula skills and it was always with a mixture of pride and relief when I finally got each of these working.

Sick formula number 1: Retrieve the value of the checkbox on the meals sheet to copy it onto the ingredients sheet (for slightly easier Google Sheets API querying)

```
=VLOOKUP(G1, INDIRECT("The other spreadsheet!A:B"), 2)
```

![checkbox-copy-formula](/assets/img/yummy-spreadsheets/checkbox-copy-formula.gif){: class="edgeless-image"}

Sick formula number 2: Conditional formatting to indicate if a selected recipe doesnâ€™t have an entry in the ingredients sheet:

```
=AND(B1 = TRUE,COUNTIF(INDIRECT("'Ingredients'!1:1"),A1) <= 0)
```

![no-ingreeds-formula](/assets/img/yummy-spreadsheets/no-ingreeds-formula.png){: class="edgeless-image"}
Red means _danger_.

Sick formula number 3: Conditional formatting to indicate when an ingredient doesnâ€™t have a category defined on the Ingredient types sheet:

```
=AND(NOT(ISBLANK(H4)),COUNTIF(INDIRECT("'Ingredient types'!A:A"),RIGHT(H4,LEN(H4) - FIND(" ", H4))) <= 0)
```

![no-type-formula](/assets/img/yummy-spreadsheets/no-type-formula.png){: class="edgeless-image"}
The consequences of this are just that it wonâ€™t be grouped together with its collocated ingredients in the resulting list, so this orangey yellow colour will do for severity.

### Talking tech

Here are my thoughts, feelings, and motivations around the tech choices I made for this.

#### TypeScript

The first time I encountered TypeScript was in December 2016 when one of my favourite colleagues used it to write a new service as his final contribution before departing the company. When I subsequently came to maintaining it, I was overcome with frustration and disbelief at how difficult I was finding it to make my simple changes. He told me later that one day weâ€™d all see the light, and itâ€™s important to me that he never finds out that he was right and that these days I actually think itâ€™s super useful.

The usefulness of type safety stole up on me gradually. Having made the decision a couple of years into my career to reject Java and all its mad verbosity for the free-and-easy alternative that was JavaScript, I had come to see static typing as a hangover from a less âœ¨agile âœ¨time.

But then more recently I found myself encountering bugs and thinking â€˜dang, I should have written a unit test to check thatâ€™ or â€˜dang, I should have put some defensive type checks in for those function parametersâ€™, and then it occurred to me that _instead_ I could do what lots of other JavaScript fans are doing these days and write in TypeScript.

A turning point for me was when I heard that you can write TypeScript but still keep it loosey goosey by allowing for â€˜implicit anyâ€™ (â€˜anyâ€™ as in â€˜anything goesâ€™) so you didnâ€™t have to actually write any type definitions if you donâ€™t want to, and you can add them later where you feel theyâ€™ll be most useful.

This is how I approached it in this project and it was great. I ended up writing just a few types but they were very helpful. I really like the fact that if I want to add a new property to a type, I can update an interface and itâ€™ll immediately tell me everywhere in the project I need to update the code that uses it. Itâ€™s like really low-rent magic.

_(In the n months since I wrote this system/blog though, my TypeScript usage has evolved and Iâ€™ve done away with implicit any)_

#### Serverless framework + AWS Lambda

I absolutely love working with serverless stuff now. It just feels so easy to get stuff going.

A big part of this is [the Serverless framework](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/), which is a properly good framework for deploying cloud functions and configuring event sources such as API Gateways and time schedules with super easy config. Iâ€™m not exaggerating. I love it.

AWS Lambda got even better in April 2018 (shortly before I wrote this system) when it started allowing you to run stuff in Node 8.10, opening the door to my new favourite syntactic sweeties, `async` and `await`, which made for some very neat promise-based asynchronous code.

#### The Google Sheets REST API

Iâ€™m glad I chose to go with the sheets API route. The alternative was to write a script in the Google Sheets script editor and dumping the results into another sheet. I have had a go at this sort of thing before but found it a bit of an uphill struggle, and it leaves no room for nice unit tests or TypeScript or whatever.

The API is fairly intuitive to use and very nicely documented (Iâ€™m sure if youâ€™re interested youâ€™ll google it but here are the Google Sheets REST API docs anyway).

### Bon appÃ©tit

In conclusion, this was a fun mini project and Iâ€™ll be making use of its fruits for many years to come. Hooray!

As I mentioned, if you wanted to try and integrate this approach into your own life, Iâ€™ve made my code and my spreadsheet template (with all those juicy formulas) available for all. Find them in the [Sharing is caring section](#sharing-is-caring).
