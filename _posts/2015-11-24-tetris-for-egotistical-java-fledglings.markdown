*LrnceTetris* is a game I wrote in April 2010, just at the tail end of the second year of my Comp Sci degree (an explanation of the name 'Lrnce' and its derivatives is a whole other blog post). It's not the first in its category of did-all-the-fun-stuff-then-got-bored hobby coding projects I've worked on over the years but it is the first I'm willing to exhibit with only a slight accompanying cringe.

The premise of the game is... Tetris! Of course. It's a Tetris clone. What budding games programmer hasn't seen appeal in Tetris's simple action, it's easy art, it's instant familiarity. There's something about creating your own version of a game you've previously consumed with unblinking glee that really makes a project exciting.

The main USP of this particular incarnation is the degree of graphical flair. The board is framed by a picture of me, gazing more or less in the direction of the player and wearing a strikingly neutral expression. Each block has a picture of one of my school friends on, and I was pretty proud of the end-game animation too.

I decompiled the .jar thinking the five-year-old code within would be positively *hilarious* (If you're into that sort of thing), but found that in reality it was just long and boring. All `swing.Timer` this and `extends JPanel` that. Nevertheless, it was a nice trip down memory lane.

Bonus content: The gif Google Photos made of all of my frame images. I vaguely recall having plans to have my face react when certain game events took place. Sadly, this dream was never realised, but at least we retain this small momento
